Cafe Directory Web Application

This web application allows users to add cafes to a local directory, storing essential information such as the cafe's name, location, rating, and available amenities (WiFi and charging points). Built with Flask and integrated with Bootstrap for a responsive design, the application features a form for cafe submissions and displays a table of added cafes. The data is stored in a text file, ensuring easy access and future updates. The app also offers a user-friendly interface for navigating through the directory and adding new cafes.

Download the files and store them in the following order:
